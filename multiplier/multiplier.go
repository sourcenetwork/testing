/*
The multiplier package provides a collection of functions used to help scale tests with
the complexity multipliers present in the production code.

A complexity multiplier represents a concept that multiplies the surface area and complexity
of other proximal features, for example, database transactions are complexity modifiers, as
when adding many new database actions such as a new filter operation, the new action must be
tested both with, and without a transaction - the transaction concept multiplies the complexity
of the system.

Complexity multipliers are represented in this package by the [Multiplier] interface.  Concrete
implementations of this interface should be defined in the packages consuming this package, and then
registered by calling [Register].  This is typically done in an `init` function in the package defining
the concrete type.

Once all desired [Multiplier]s have been registered, [Init] should be called in order to select
which of the registered multipliers are active and should be used to modify the set of actions provided
to [Apply].

[Apply] should be called once per test, and will modify the given set of actions in order to test the
active complexity multipliers.

[Multiplier]s do not have any impact during action execution, they act only on the action set itself,
redefining, creating or deleting elements from the test definition *before* the action set executes.

// Multiplier represents a complexity multiplier of the system under test.
//
// It represents a concept that multiplies the surface area and complexity
// of other proximal features, for example, database transactions are
// complexity modifiers, as when adding many new database actions such as
// a new filter operation, the new action must be tested both with, and without
// a transaction - the transaction concept multiplies the complexity of the system.
//
// The identification and automatic representation of complexity multipiers are critical
// to the long term maintainability and scalability of a codebase. Without them, introducing
// fairly simple features becomes high risk, and requires a forever growing number of manually
// constructed tests, when the feature developer needs to remember, and write tests for every
// multiplier that affects the feature under test.  This is error prone, very tedious, and
// distracts from the feature itself - often degrading the quality of both test and production code.
//
// Complexity multipliers defined using this type may redefine the set of test actions
// to perform within a test, allowing a single test to scale with the complexity
// multiplier.  For example, applying a 'namespace' multplier may add an action that
// namespaces the store under test, reducing, but not removing, testing cost of the
// namespace multiplier.
